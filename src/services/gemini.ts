        rant: "Rant-style content works by positioning you as a truth-teller cutting through industry nonsense. Speak directly to camera with passion and conviction. Use phrases like 'I can't believe people still...' and 'Here's what nobody's telling you...' Focus on common industry mistakes and position your solution as the obvious answer.",
        skit: "Skit-style content uses simple before/after scenarios with 2-3 characters to demonstrate transformation. Create a relatable problem scenario, introduce your solution, then show the dramatic improvement. Use basic props and clear character roles. Works best when the problem and solution are visually demonstrable.",
        story: "Story-style ads follow a classic narrative arc with a character facing a challenge, trying solutions, discovering your product, and achieving transformation. Use customer stories or create composite characters. Include emotional touchpoints and clear before/after contrast. Most effective when you can show genuine transformation.",
        qa: "Q&A style positions you as the expert answering common questions in your niche. Start with a frequently asked question, provide valuable insights, then position your product as the ultimate solution or shortcut. Include numbered steps or bullet points for clarity. End by inviting more questions to boost engagement.",
        interview: "Interview-style content features conversations with customers, team members or industry experts. Use simple shot/reverse-shot format with clear questions and authentic responses. Focus on transformation stories and specific results. Can be scripted but should feel natural and conversational.",
        duet: "Duet-style content responds directly to trending videos in your niche. React to content about problems your product solves, then offer your superior solution. Use split-screen format with the original content on one side. Works best when piggybacking on viral trends relevant to your industry.",
        stitch: "Stitch-style content clips a small portion of another video then continues with your response. Use this to answer questions, correct misinformation, or add value to viral content in your niche. Keep your addition concise and valuable. Works best when the original content is highly relevant to your audience.",
        vlog: "Vlog-style content offers behind-the-scenes looks at your business, product development, or customer success stories. Use casual, authentic filming with minimal editing. Show real people and processes to build trust. Particularly effective for humanizing your brand and building connection.",
        pov: "POV (point of view) content puts viewers in the first-person perspective of using your product or experiencing the problem it solves. Film as if through the eyes of the user. Use text overlays to guide the narrative. Especially effective for products with a clear experiential benefit."
